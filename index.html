<p>I am a <b>computational evolutionary biologist</b> working as an <b>independent contractor</b> from a farm outside of Ottawa, Canada. My work involves software development and system administration in support of scientific research and teaching.</p>

<p>During my <b>academic career</b>, I worked on phylogenetic inference (building evolutionary trees from DNA sequences)
and phyloinformatics (synthesis and management of phylogenetic data). I was lead PI of the <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">Open Tree of Life</a> project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life.
</p>

<p>I am a passionate supporter of <b>Open Science and Reproducible Science</b> - making
research data, scientific software, and publications freely available for
review, use, and re-use.</p>

<p>In support of open and reproducible science, I teach software and data skills
through <b><a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a></b> and their lesson
programs <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. The Carpentries run
two-day workshops for researchers that aim to increase research efficiency
through introduction of foundational skills in computational and data
science.</p>
