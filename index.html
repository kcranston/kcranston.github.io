<p>I am a post-academic <b>computational evolutionary biologist</b> working in software development that supports data sharing and research. My current role is Team Lead of the <a href="https://www.distributedgenomics.ca/">CanDIG</a> platform, a project of the University Health Network Data Aggregation, Translation, and Architecture (<a href="https://uhndata.io/">DATA</a>) team.</p>

<p>During my <b>academic career</b>, I worked on phylogenetic inference (building evolutionary trees from DNA sequences)
and phyloinformatics (synthesis and management of phylogenetic data). I was lead PI of the <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">Open Tree of Life</a> project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life.
</p>

<p>I am a passionate supporter of <b>Open Science and Reproducible Science</b> - making
research data, scientific software, and publications freely available for
review, use, and re-use.</p>

<p>In support of open and reproducible science, I have long been involved with teaching and leadership of <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> and their lesson
programs <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a
