<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist in the Department of Biology at
Duke University. Previously, I was the Bioinformatics Project Manager and
Training Coordinator at the (sadly-defunct) National Evolutionary Synthesis
Center, NESCent. </p>

<p>My research focuses on phylogenetic inference and phyloinformatics. I am
currently the lead PI of the Open Tree of Life project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life by synthesizing phylogeny and
taxonomy. Browse the tree of life on the <a
href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">opentree website</a>; improve the tree by
<a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">submitting and curating
published trees</a>; or find <a
href="https://github.com/opentreeoflife">opentree code on github</a>
</p>

<p>When not
building the tree of life, I help teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>.</p>
