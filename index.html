<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist in the Department of Biology at
Duke University. Previously, I was the Bioinformatics Project Manager and Training Coordinator at the (sadly-defunct) National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, NESCent. </p>

<p>Most of my time is spend on the
Open Tree of Life project, which builds a comprehensive tree of all life by synthesizing phylogeny and taxonomy. Browse the tree of life on the <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">opentree website</a>; <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">submit and curate published trees for inclusion</a>; or find <a href="https://github.com/opentreeoflife">opentree code on github</a>
</p>

<p>When not
building the tree of life, I help teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. When not sitting a desk,
I am often found riding ponies. </p>
