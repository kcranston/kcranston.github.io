<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist at the Biological Informatics 
Centre of Excellence at <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/home/?id=1395690825741">Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada</a> 
(AAFC). Prior to 
moving to AAFC, I was a research scientist in the Department of Biology at
Duke University. At AAFC, I am working on infrastructure and data management to  
support a digitization and sequencing project for the in-house specimen 
collections. </p>

<p>My research focuses on phylogenetic inference (building evolutionary trees)
and phyloinformatics (synthesis and management of phylogenetic data). I was
the lead PI of the Open Tree of Life project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life by synthesizing phylogeny and
taxonomy. Browse the tree of life on the <a
href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">opentree website</a>; improve the tree by
<a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">submitting and curating
published trees</a>; or find <a
href="https://github.com/opentreeoflife">opentree code on github</a>
</p>

<p>I am a passionate supporter of Open Science and Reproducible Science - making
research data, scientific software, and publications freely available for
review, use, and re-use.</p>

<p>In support of Open and Reproducible Science, I teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. These organizations
run two-day workshops for researchers that aim to increase research efficiency
through introduction of foundational skills in computational and data
science.</p>
