<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist in the Department of Biology at
Duke University. Before moving over to Biology, I was the Bioinformatics Project
Manager and Training Coordinator at the (sadly-defunct) National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center, NESCent. </p>

<p>My research focuses on phylogenetic inference (building evolutionary trees)
and phyloinformatics (synthesis and management of phylogenetic data). I am
currently the lead PI of the Open Tree of Life project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life by synthesizing phylogeny and
taxonomy. Browse the tree of life on the <a
href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">opentree website</a>; improve the tree by
<a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator">submitting and curating
published trees</a>; or find <a
href="https://github.com/opentreeoflife">opentree code on github</a>
</p>

<p>I am a passionate supporter of Open Science and Reproducible Science - making
research data, scientific software, and publications freely available for
review, use, and re-use.</p>

<p>When not building the tree of life, I teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. These organizations
run two-day workshops for researchers that aim to increase research efficiency
through introduction of foundational skills in computational and data
science.</p>
