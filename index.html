<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist working as an independent contractor from a farm outside of Ottawa, Canada. My work involves software development and system administration in support of scientific research and teaching.</p>

<p>My doctoral work in statistical genetics at U Alberta was followed by positions as a postdoctoral fellow (University of Arizona and The Field Museum of Natural History), bioinformatics manager (National Evolutionary Synthesis Center), and then research scientist (Duke University). I then left the US and adademia for good, returning to the motherland as a Technical Advisor in Bioinformatics at <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/home/?id=1395690825741">Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada</a>
(AAFC).</p>

<p>During my academic career, I worked on phylogenetic inference (building evolutionary trees from DNA sequences)
and phyloinformatics (synthesis and management of phylogenetic data). I was lead PI of the <a href="https://tree.opentreeoflife.org">Open Tree of Life</a> project, which builds and keeps
up to date a comprehensive tree of all life.
</p>

<p>I am a passionate supporter of Open Science and Reproducible Science - making
research data, scientific software, and publications freely available for
review, use, and re-use.</p>

<p>In support of open and reproducible science, I teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a> and their lesson
programs <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. The Carpentries run
two-day workshops for researchers that aim to increase research efficiency
through introduction of foundational skills in computational and data
science.</p>
