<p>I am a computational evolutionary biologist in the Department of Biology at
Duke University. Most of my time is spend on the <a
href="https://opentreeoflife.org">Open Tree of Life</a> project, which is prodoving a comprehensive tree of all life by synthesizing phylogeny and taxonomy. When not
building the tree of life, I help teach software and data skills
through <a href="https://software-carpentry.org">Software</a> and <a
href="https://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>. When not sitting a desk,
I am often found riding ponies. </p>
