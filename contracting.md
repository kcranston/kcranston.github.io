I occasionally do software development work as an independent contractor. My areas of
interest are software and infrastructure development in support of scientific
research and teaching. Skills include:

* extensive Python programming experience (web applications, database interactions, library development, scripting, Jupyter notebooks)
* databases (SQL, particularly PostgreSQL)
* API design and development
* Ansible deployment
* JupyterHub and Kubernetes

**Previous clients**

\end{itemize}
