This is the third in a series of posts on the book [Small Teaching: Everyday
Lessons from the Science of
Learning](http://www.jamesmlang.com/p/small-teaching.html) by James M. Lang.

## Chapter 2 - Predicting

The second *Small Teaching* practice shows how prediction improves retention and
comprehension. It starts by introducing a few research studies, including one
very elegant (and surprising!) one from Kornell, Hayes, and Bjork
[dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0015729](https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0015729). They asked
students to memorize pairs of loosely connected words (*'olive–branch'*,
*'mouse–hole'*,*'whale–mammal'*). One group got 13 seconds to study the pair,
while the other had 8 seconds with the first word only, then had to predict the
second word, then got 5 seconds with the word pair. When tested on how well they
could recollect the second word, given the first word, the second group
significantly outperformed the first group. Note that this isn't the kind of
test where careful thought would lead to better predictions ('whale' could
easily pair with a huge number of possible words). Students learned
better when they had to predict the answer - even if it was the wrong answer.

One reason for this touches on an important difference between knowledge
in experts vs novices. Experts have a dense network of connections
between facts, while the knowledge of novices is sparse. When adding new facts
to this dense network, an expert makes multiple connections and more easily
sees how to use the new knowledge. Learning using prediction works much the same
way, activating prior knowledge, and adding the new information tightly into
the network of information we already have. It may also help us to see the gaps
in our knowledge, through wrong prediction ('Illusions of fluency' is the term
for what this exposes. I think we've all been there.)

In the context of a Carpentry lesson, we can think about using prediction when
introducing a more complex construct ('what happens when we combine grep and
wc together?'), when we are modifying an existing problem ('how will the graph
change if we make this change to our matplotlib code?'), or when introducing a
new concept ('how can you imagine using version control in your current work?').

No matter the way you use prediction, you want to make sure that the learners
get the right answer soon after the prediction (not much of a concern in a
Carpentry-length lesson), making sure you provide time for students to ponder
(it is tempting, when rushing through a lesson, to not wait long enough), and
to build on existing knowledge (not asking for predictions before you have
provided enough context).
