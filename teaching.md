I am passionate about teaching computational skills to scientists. All of my teaching is in the workshop format and much of it through the excellent [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) organizations. I've been teaching for the carpentries since 2008, and I am a founding board member of Data Carpentry. As part of my previous position as Informatics Project Manager and Training Coordinator at the now-defunct [National Evolutionary Synthesis Center](http://nescent.org/), I ran our summer NESCent Academy workshop program and taught phylogeny workshops through our NESCent Ambassador program in developing countries.

As part of the process for becoming a Software / Data Carpentry trainer-of-trainers (i.e. able to run instructor training sessions), I have a series of blog posts on pedagogy. [Start reading them here](/blog/2016/10/small-teaching-part-one).
